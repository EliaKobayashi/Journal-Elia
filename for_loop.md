## Series-1
### Given two integers A and B (A ≤ B). Print all numbers from A to B inclusively.

## Series-2
### Given two integers A and B. Print all numbers from A to B inclusively, in ascending order, if A < B, or in descending order, if A ≥ B.
## Sum of Ten Numbers
### 10 numbers are given in the input. Read them and print their sum. Use as few variables as you can.
