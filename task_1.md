## Question 1:
### Do you think it is necessary to involve the show owner during the process along the three weeks? Or alternatively, is it better to involve him only when the product is finished? Explain your answer
I believe that it depends on the needs and wants of the shop owner. If they would like to go through the process to have a final product more tailored to their likings it would be necessary to involve them. However, if the client does not have many preferences and/or does not have much time, involving the client is unnecessary. 
## Question 2:
### Do you think it is necessary to create MVPs for your game? If so, what would some of the MPV look like and what do you expect to obtain from the client?
Creating MVP’s for this game is necessary. By creating MVP’s, I can better understand the needs and wants of the client. For my first product, I would create a simple football game to see if the client likes a sports text-based game. If they do like it, I would create a tournament style game. If they like that product as well, I would create a tournament style game featuring real clubs. Then, I would create a game in which the client can create their own player and play in a tournament. The final step would be to create a game where the client can create their own player, sign to different real life clubs, play in the champions league, and have a rating system.
## Question 3:
### Do you see similarities between the Human-Centered Design cycle presented in the video and the Design Cycle we use for developing software? Explain.
In the Human-Centered Design Cycle, people first get an idea from observations in the everyday world, they implement the idea by creating something out of it, they test to see if their idea solves the problem they observed, then they observe the flaws in their prototype. This cycle keeps going until the prototype is perfect. The Design Cycle has similar steps. You first get an idea, you design it, you create a prototype, you evaluate the flaws, and you change the product. Both cycles have a similar concept of trying to find flaws and keep fixing them in your product until your product is perfect.
## Question 4:
### What are the simple principles for human-centered design presented in the video? Write a sentence with the definition of each.
One is discoverability. Discoverability is the ability to discover what operations one can do. Another is feedback. Feedback is a signal of what happened.
## Question 5:
### Consider your game. Think about ways you can improve the Players’ Experience using Human-centered design. Write below your ideas:
1. Multiple languages to accommodate different users.
2. Make sure the narration is detailed enough to make it realistic.
3. Realistic in game scenarios where the users have to decide what their player does.
